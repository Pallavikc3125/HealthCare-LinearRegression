# HealthCare-LinearRegression

Linear regression can be used in a healthcare project, let's say that you are working on a project to predict the melting temperature (TM) of a protein based on its sequence.

The TM of a protein is a measure of the stability of the protein and is an important factor in drug design and other applications.

You have a dataset containing the sequences and TMs of a number of proteins, and you want to build a model that can predict the TM of a protein based on its sequence. 
You can use linear regression for this task.

If the protein-sequence column in your dataset contains categorical data (i.e., non-numeric data that can be divided into categories), you can still use linear regression to build a model to predict the tm column.
However, you will need to convert the categorical data into a numerical form that the model can understand.

Linear regression is a statistical model that is used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.


Collect the data: You need to gather the protein sequences and their corresponding TMs. You can use the seq_id column as a unique identifier for each protein.

Preprocess the data: You may need to preprocess the data before you can use it to fit the model. For example, you may need to encode the protein sequences as numerical data, or standardize the TMs.

Split the data: Split the data into a training set and a test set, using a suitable splitting ratio such as 70/30 or 80/20. The training set will be used to fit the model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

Fit the model: Use the training set to fit a linear regression model. You can use the protein_sequence column as the input feature and the tm column as the output.

Evaluate the model: Use the test set to evaluate the model's performance. You can use metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of the model.

Make predictions: Use the model to make predictions on new protein sequences. You can input the sequence of a protein and the model will output the predicted TM.
